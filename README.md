   A mechanical sport par excellence, F1 has acquired an incredible level of technicality and complexity over
the years. The result of very strict regulatory constraints to guarantee the safety of drivers and the fair play of
the competition, it pushes manufacturers to take advantage of digital tools such as simulation and data analysis
to optimize the performance of single-seaters.

   The issue at stake in this sport has become more global. There is not only a sporting competition but also
a technical competition between the teams to improve their performance by using new technologies to make
better solutions. Data analysis and visualization are robust tools to not only detect problems and defects, but
also find the most optimum solution for them. Analyzing and visualizing huge amount of data generated in this
industry can lead to better performance of cars, drivers and technicians.
