F1 teams rely on partnerships with technology providers, leveraging high-performance computing, machine learning and edge computing to gain an edge on the track. These relationships are also valuable to service providers, showcasing cutting-edge uses for their data center technologies. A Formula 1 car contains about 80,000 components, according to Keyworthand 90% of them will see replacement throughout the 23-race season in the interests of optimization. Analyzing data associated with these many different parts allows team members to correlate performance advantages, on the basis of both real and simulated races. Its hard to overstate the role technology plays in F1 racing. Every F1 car contains 300 sensors which generate 1.1 million telemetry data points per second transmitted from the cars to the pits. During each race weekend 160 terabytes of data is sent between the remote race circuit and the F1 Media and Technology Center. The world of Formula 1 contains a lot of questions and the study of data is a way to find solution for some of these questions. For this project we decided to look at data to answer following questions: 1- What is the spread of Formula 1 circuits around the world Since 1950? 2- How is the performance of drivers in the track as race is going? And how Pit stop plays role in the performance? 3- Constructor (Team) performance and the role of drivers in its the performance. 4-What is the role of technology in Formula 1? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Sources : Look at the source website https://ergast.com/mrd/db/ The dataset consists of several files related to Formula one racing sports. The files contain technical information on tracks, races, constructors and drivers. In addition, data and information about the performance of the teams and drivers such as lap times and accidents are available. The data was collected by a simple download. However, there is an API that allows to make GET requests using url in order to get specific data ( link ). The data records races, constructor and driver data since 1950. Each record in each file is identified by an unique id allowing to merge the information tables. Since most of the plots that shown in the results section is produced by thre filese, results.csv, constructor_standings.csv and driver_standings.csv. here we show the first 5 rows of this data file. ## # A tibble: 5 x 18 ## resultId raceId driverId constructorId number grid position positionText ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 18 1 1 22 1 1 1 ## 2 2 18 2 2 3 5 2 2 ## 3 3 18 3 3 7 7 3 3 ## 4 4 18 4 4 5 11 4 4 ## 5 5 18 5 1 23 3 5 5 ## # ... with 10 more variables: positionOrder &lt;dbl&gt;, points &lt;dbl&gt;, laps &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # time &lt;chr&gt;, milliseconds &lt;chr&gt;, fastestLap &lt;chr&gt;, rank &lt;chr&gt;, ## # fastestLapTime &lt;chr&gt;, fastestLapSpeed &lt;chr&gt;, statusId &lt;dbl&gt; ## # A tibble: 5 x 7 ## constructorStandingsId raceId constructorId points position positionText wins ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 18 1 14 1 1 1 ## 2 2 18 2 8 3 3 0 ## 3 3 18 3 9 2 2 0 ## 4 4 18 4 5 4 4 0 ## 5 5 18 5 2 5 5 0 ## # A tibble: 5 x 7 ## driverStandingsId raceId driverId points position positionText wins ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 18 1 10 1 1 1 ## 2 2 18 2 8 2 2 0 ## 3 3 18 3 6 3 3 0 ## 4 4 18 4 5 4 4 0 ## 5 5 18 5 4 5 5 0 We have also more technical information in our data set such as information about lap times: ## # A tibble: 5 x 6 ## raceId driverId lap position time milliseconds ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;time&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 841 20 1 1 01:38 98109 ## 2 841 20 2 1 01:33 93006 ## 3 841 20 3 1 01:32 92713 ## 4 841 20 4 1 01:32 92803 ## 5 841 20 5 1 01:32 92342 "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The process of getting the data into a form in which we could work with it in R was little challenging. First the csv data files are downloaded. Then the read_csv function from reader package was used to store the data as lists in the corresponding variable. library(readr) circuits &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/circuits.csv&quot;) constructor_results &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/constructor_results.csv&quot;) constructor_standings &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/constructor_standings.csv&quot;) constructors &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/constructors.csv&quot;) driver_standings &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/driver_standings.csv&quot;) drivers &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/drivers.csv&quot;) lap_times &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/lap_times.csv&quot;) pit_stops &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/pit_stops.csv&quot;) qualifying &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/qualifying.csv&quot;) races &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/races.csv&quot;) results &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/results.csv&quot;) status &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/status.csv&quot;) One of the challenges of this project was dealing with time variables in data set. Firs, it was needed to make sure our time variables are stored in the correct format (Time format variable). Another challenge with these variable was that in our data set they are represented in two columns that is needed to be considered. Since the Formula one racing is very close between cars and constructors, times such as lap times is measured in milliseconds. As you can see in our data for lap times in Data sourced chapter, lap times are in two columns, time and milliseconds. Therefore, additional consideration is needed whenever it is needed to work with these variables. Another challenge of working with these data set was scatter of data in the different files. At the beginning, it was considered to create a large data frame of all variables that is needed and work with that. However, since we did not use all variables for all of our plots, we found that it is not efficient. For each of the plots. Therefore, for each of the plot a separate small dataframe was created. To be more familiar with formula one racing sports and our data set. Here we represents some basic plots. Here is the top 10 constructors with most wins (most points in each race count as one win for that race for each constructors) since 1950: Here is the top 10 drivers with most wins since 1950: "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Even in a well-designed and controlled study, missing data occurs in almost all research. Missing data can reduce the statistical power of a study and can produce biased estimates, leading to invalid conclusions.Missing data (or missing values) is defined as the data value that is not stored for a variable in the observation of interest. The most important file in our data set is results.csv. Looking to this file you will find some (\\N) value for time and position. However, all of these value are not missing values. This is because of the rules in formula one racing. Noticing the status column of rows with these values (\\N), it can be noticed that the cars could not finish the race due to the damages or lapping by the winner of the race. For these cars the data for position, time, rank, fastestlap fastestlaptime and fastestspeed was not recorded . Therefore, there is no data for them but not because of missing the data. It is because of the rules and damages. However, in order to have some idea about them we try to show them as follow. For fastestlaptime and fastestspeed it is different, for these two value in our data set, there is no data recorded before 2004.

The plot shows the top 13th patterns of having (\\N) values. As can be seen having the complete data set is the 4th popular pattern. The most popular pattern of having (\\N) value is having this value in the seven columns that mentioned earlier. Finally, it should be mentione that these value are not missing and they just did not measured due to the damage or lapping the car by winner of the race.

First, we represent and show the locations of circuits around the worlds since 1950. 5.1 Formula 1 circuits spread since 1950 There are 77 circuits that have hosted a Formula 1 race since 1950. These circuits can be categorized in three different groups:permanent circuits, semi-permanent circuits and circuits created in urbanization like in Monaco. Most of the circuits were in Europe since most of the Formula one team are from Europe and the logistic of transportation is easier in Europe due to the lack of technology in old days. From the 1980s, Formula 1 races were held on the American continents and then from the 2000s in Asia. A total of 32 countries have already hosted a Formula 1 Grand Prix. Here is a map listing all the circuits practiced since 1950. The number of races being proportional to the radius of the circle. .html-widget { margin: auto; } As you can see in the map, the 2 most mythical circuits are Monza in Italy and Monaco in Monte-Carlo. There have been 71 and 67 races respectively. 5.2 Italy Grand Prix 2021 (Monza) stats and driver performance As it was mentioned before, the Italian Grand Prix is one of the most prestigious and famous Formula 1 races of the season. Due to the history and since Italy is the home of oldest formula 1 team (Ferrari) we specifically investigate the data of driver on this track for 2021. In the 2021, 19 drivers were on the starting line. This graph allows us to follow the progress of the race over the laps. We can notice on the 22nd lap a recurrent movement between the drivers. This corresponds to the pit stops which are inevitable at this level of the race for all the drivers. Pit stop is one of the most important strategic decisions that each of the team should consider fo each of the track. The team consider so many factors such as previous results, type of Tyre, whether and location of track to figure it out how many pit stop they need and in which lap. As this graph shows, one pit stop in lap 22en is the famous options for most of the teams in 2021. At the finish line, out of the 19 pilots, only 15 crossed it. Here are the reasons: Position laps Last Name First Name Nationality Constructor Status 1 1 53 Ricciardo Daniel Australian McLaren Finished 2 2 53 Norris Lando British McLaren Finished 14 3 53 Bottas Valtteri Finnish Mercedes Finished 6 4 53 Leclerc Charles Monegasque Ferrari Finished 7 5 53 Pérez Sergio Mexican Red Bull Finished 5 6 53 Sainz Carlos Spanish Ferrari Finished 12 7 53 Stroll Lance Canadian Aston Martin Finished 19 8 53 Alonso Fernando Spanish Alpine F1 Team Finished 4 9 53 Russell George British Williams Finished 20 10 53 Ocon Esteban French Alpine F1 Team Finished 3 11 53 Latifi Nicholas Canadian Williams Finished 11 12 53 Vettel Sebastian German Aston Martin Finished 10 13 53 Giovinazzi Antonio Italian Alfa Romeo Finished 9 14 53 Kubica Robert Polish Alfa Romeo Finished 15 15 53 Schumacher Mick German Haas F1 Team Finished 16 16 41 Mazepin Nikita Russian Haas F1 Team Power Unit 13 17 25 Hamilton Lewis British Mercedes Collision 8 18 25 Verstappen Max Dutch Red Bull Collision 17 19 3 Gasly Pierre French AlphaTauri Suspension 18 20 0 Tsunoda Yuki Japanese AlphaTauri Brakes During this race we can notice a lightning rise of the Finnish pilot Valtteri Bottas. The following graph shows the lap time for Valtteri Bottas and Daniel Richardo who won this race. As can be seen, Botass lost timein the first 12 laps of this race as compared to Daniel Richardo. After lap 12 Bottas was faster but not fast enough to win the race. However, he could improve his standing after lap 12. 5.3 Constructor (Team) performance We can see on the following graph the proportion of victory of each constructor on the number of realized races. The graph is ordered from left to right according to the decreasing number of victories. If two drivers of the same constructor participate in the same race it is counted as two chances to win and therefore two races. As can be seen, Ferrari has the most wins since it is the oldest Formula 1 team but a lower proportion of win than Mercedes or Red Bull. This shows that Mercedes or Red bull are more efficient that Ferrari. Formula One is certainly a sport in which pilots push their performance but it is also a technological competition between constructors. Each constructor wants to recruit the best drivers in order to prove that their technology is the best during the races on the circuits. In the same way, each driver wants to join the most prestigious constructors in order to have more means and the most performing machines. This figure shows the association of drivers to each of the constructors since 2000. We have drivers like Verstappen who since the beginning of his career in 2016 is dear the same constructor (Red Bull) and drivers like Räikkönen who have changed constructors several times (Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, McLaren). Considering This graph with the driver with most wins in Data transformations sections, we can conclude that one the important paramenter in constructor performance is drivers. The most successful teams such as Mercedes or Red Bull have the best drivers for long time. 5.4 The role of Technology in Formula 1 In this plot we tried to show the fastest lap speed over the time in seven different tracks. Unfortunately, our data set does not have the data for fastest lap before 2004. We have some missing value in this plot, it is because in some years there was not race in thoes locations. As can be seen in this plot, the average speed is higher in some circuits due to the geometry of that circuit. For example Italian grand Prix has one of the highest speed circuits. For most of the circuit, the fastest speed lap increases over the time. It should be mentioned that this increase is more before 2004 but unfortunately, we do not have the data. After, 2004, due to the safety of the drivers, the FIA tries to keep the fastest lap below 300 km/hr. Another area that was influenced by technology is pit stop. Here you can see the duration of pit stop for some circuits. Pit stop in formula 1 is very important and improving the duration is very hard. For some years we have increase in the duration, one of the reasons can be changing the length of pit stop lane in some circuits. However, generally the pit stop duration decreased by millisecond in the tracks. Most of this reduction is because of the new tools and technology in Formula 1. Logistic is one of the most important sections of Formula 1 sports. Transferring all equipment, containers, cars around the world for each of the races needs managements and tools. Technology helps team to transfer their staff much easier these years from one continents to another in less than one week. In this plot it can be see number of races per year. As can bee seen in this plot, generally, the number of races per year is increased. One of the reasons is technology and the being able to transfer fast and easier these year. However, technology is not the only reason we are able to watch more races today. Popularity and financial aspects of formula 1 are also important that we can have more races nowadays.

Intent on finishing in first place, teams constantly strive to extract the best possible performance from their cars in each and every race. Increasingly, one of the most important competitive advantages in this relentless pursuit of excellence is data. By gathering and analyzing it, teams are finding new and innovative ways to win. In this project we tried to visualize formula 1 Data so answer some of the general questions in this fiels as follow: 1- What is the spread of Formula 1 circuits around the world Since 1950? We show that since 1950 that formula 1 has started, 77 circuits hosted the race. Between all circuits, 2 most mythical circuits are Monza in Italy and Monaco in Monte-Carlo. 2- How is the performance of drivers in the track as race is going? And how Pit stop plays role in the performance? The position of the drivers in Monza (Italian grand Prix) at 2021 was shown in the plot along with final position in the table. It can be seen that lap 22 was the most popular lap for pit stop in this race. Finally the lap time of two drivers, Valtteri Bottas and Daniel Richardo(Winner of the eace), was shown since lap time is one the most factor in driver performance. 3- Constructor (Team) performance and the role of drivers in its the performance. For this section, the proportion of victory of each constructors was shown. It was discussed that one of the most important factor in team performance is drivers and how the best teams most of the times have the best drivers. 4-What is the role of technology in Formula 1? For this section, it was shown for most of the circuits, the average fastest speed and pit stop duration were increased and decreased respectively but not significant. It was discussed that onr of the potential reasons for that can be the role of technology. Finally, it was shown the role of technology in logistic of formula 1 by representing the nu,ber of races per year since Formula 1 started.
