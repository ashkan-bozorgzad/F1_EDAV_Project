F1 teams rely on partnerships with technology providers, leveraging high-performance computing, machine learning and edge computing to gain an edge on the track. These relationships are also valuable to service providers, showcasing cutting-edge uses for their data center technologies. A Formula 1 car contains about 80,000 components, according to Keyworthand 90% of them will see replacement throughout the 23-race season in the interests of optimization. Analyzing data associated with these many different parts allows team members to correlate performance advantages, on the basis of both real and simulated races. Its hard to overstate the role technology plays in F1 racing. Every F1 car contains 300 sensors which generate 1.1 million telemetry data points per second transmitted from the cars to the pits. During each race weekend 160 terabytes of data is sent between the remote race circuit and the F1 Media and Technology Center. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Sources : Look at the source website https://ergast.com/mrd/db/ The dataset consists of several files related to Formula one racing sports. The files contain technical information on tracks, races, constructors and drivers. In addition, data and information about the performance of the teams and drivers such as lap times and accidents are available. The data was collected by a simple download. However, there is an API that allows to make GET requests using url in order to get specific data ( link ). The data records races, constructor and driver data since 1950. Each record in each file is identified by an unique id allowing to merge the information tables. Since most of the plots that shown in the results section is produced by thre filese, results.csv, constructor_standings.csv and driver_standings.csv. here we show the first 5 rows of this data file. ## # A tibble: 5 x 18 ## resultId raceId driverId constructorId number grid position positionText ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 18 1 1 22 1 1 1 ## 2 2 18 2 2 3 5 2 2 ## 3 3 18 3 3 7 7 3 3 ## 4 4 18 4 4 5 11 4 4 ## 5 5 18 5 1 23 3 5 5 ## # ... with 10 more variables: positionOrder &lt;dbl&gt;, points &lt;dbl&gt;, laps &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # time &lt;chr&gt;, milliseconds &lt;chr&gt;, fastestLap &lt;chr&gt;, rank &lt;chr&gt;, ## # fastestLapTime &lt;chr&gt;, fastestLapSpeed &lt;chr&gt;, statusId &lt;dbl&gt; ## # A tibble: 5 x 7 ## constructorStandingsId raceId constructorId points position positionText wins ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 18 1 14 1 1 1 ## 2 2 18 2 8 3 3 0 ## 3 3 18 3 9 2 2 0 ## 4 4 18 4 5 4 4 0 ## 5 5 18 5 2 5 5 0 ## # A tibble: 5 x 7 ## driverStandingsId raceId driverId points position positionText wins ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 18 1 10 1 1 1 ## 2 2 18 2 8 2 2 0 ## 3 3 18 3 6 3 3 0 ## 4 4 18 4 5 4 4 0 ## 5 5 18 5 4 5 5 0 We have also more technical information in our data set such as information about lap times: ## # A tibble: 5 x 6 ## raceId driverId lap position time milliseconds ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;time&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 841 20 1 1 01:38 98109 ## 2 841 20 2 1 01:33 93006 ## 3 841 20 3 1 01:32 92713 ## 4 841 20 4 1 01:32 92803 ## 5 841 20 5 1 01:32 92342 "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The process of getting the data into a form in which we could work with it in R was little challenging. First the csv data files are downloaded. Then the read_csv function from reader package was used to store the data as lists in the corresponding variable. library(readr) circuits &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/circuits.csv&quot;) constructor_results &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/constructor_results.csv&quot;) constructor_standings &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/constructor_standings.csv&quot;) constructors &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/constructors.csv&quot;) driver_standings &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/driver_standings.csv&quot;) drivers &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/drivers.csv&quot;) lap_times &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/lap_times.csv&quot;) pit_stops &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/pit_stops.csv&quot;) qualifying &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/qualifying.csv&quot;) races &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/races.csv&quot;) results &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/results.csv&quot;) status &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/status.csv&quot;) One of the challenges of this project was dealing with time variables in data set. Firs, it was needed to make sure our time variables are stored in the correct format (Time format variable). Another challenge with these variable was that in our data set they are represented in two columns that is needed to be considered. Since the Formula one racing is very close between cars and constructors, times such as lap times is measured in milliseconds. As you can see in our data for lap times in Data sourced chapter, lap times are in two columns, time and milliseconds. Therefore, additional consideration is needed whenever it is needed to work with these variables. Another challenge of working with these data set was scatter of data in the different files. At the beginning, it was considered to create a large data frame of all variables that is needed and work with that. However, since we did not use all variables for all of our plots, we found that it is not efficient. For each of the plots. Therefore, for each of the plot a separate small dataframe was created. To be more familiar with formula one racing sports and our data set. Here we represents some basic plots. Here is the top 10 constructors with most wins (most points in each race count as one win for that race for each constructors) since 1950: Here is the top 10 drivers with most wins since 1950: "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Even in a well-designed and controlled study, missing data occurs in almost all research. Missing data can reduce the statistical power of a study and can produce biased estimates, leading to invalid conclusions.Missing data (or missing values) is defined as the data value that is not stored for a variable in the observation of interest. The most important file in our data set is results.csv. Looking to this file you will find some value for time and position. However, these value are not missing values. This is because of the rules in formula one racing. Noticing the status column of rows with these values (), it can be noticed that the cars could not finish the race due to the damages or lapping by the winner of the race. For these cars the data for position, time, rank, fastestlap fastestlaptime and fastestspeed was not recorded. Therefore, there is no data for them but not because of missing the data. It is because of the rules and damages. However, in order to have some idea about them we try to show them as follow. To investigate the distribution of () values by columns in results.csv: ## milliseconds time fastestLapTime fastestLap fastestLapSpeed ## 18522 18521 18445 18444 18444 ## rank position number resultId raceId ## 18249 10768 6 0 0 ## driverId constructorId grid positionText positionOrder ## 0 0 0 0 0 ## points laps statusId ## 0 0 0 As can be seen, most of the () value are in the columns mentioned above and the number of them are almost same.The following plot summarizes all () values to investigate if there is any pasterns. The plot shows the top 13th patterns of having () values. As can be seen having the complete data set is the 4th popular pattern. The most popular pattern of having () value is having this value in the seven columns that mentioned earlier. Finally, it should be mentione that these value are not missing and they just did not measured due to the damage or lapping the car by winner of the race. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Formula 1 circuits since 1950 5.2 Italy Grand Prix 2021 (Monza) 5.3 More than just a race ", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Formula 1 circuits since 1950 There are 77 circuits that have hosted a Formula 1 race since 1950. There are different types of circuits: permanent circuits, semi-permanent circuits and circuits created in urbanization like in Monaco. Initially the races were held mainly on circuits in Europe. From the 1980s onwards, Formula 1 races were held on the American continents and then from the 2000s onwards in Asia. A total of 32 countries have already hosted a Formula 1 Grand Prix. Here is a map listing all the circuits practiced since 1950. The number of races being proportional to the radius of the circle. .html-widget { margin: auto; } The 2 most mythical circuits are Monza in Italy and Monaco in Monte-Carlo. There have been 71 and 67 races respectively. 5.2 Italy Grand Prix 2021 (Monza) As said before, the Italian Grand Prix is one of the most prestigious Formula 1 races of the season. In the 2021 edition, 19 drivers were on the starting line. This graph allows us to follow the progress of the race over the laps. We can notice on the 22nd lap a recurrent movement between the drivers. This corresponds to the pit stops which are inevitable at this level of the race for all the drivers. At the finish line, out of the 19 pilots, only 15 crossed it. Here are the reasons: Position laps Last Name First Name Nationality Constructor Status 1 1 53 Ricciardo Daniel Australian McLaren Finished 2 2 53 Norris Lando British McLaren Finished 14 3 53 Bottas Valtteri Finnish Mercedes Finished 6 4 53 Leclerc Charles Monegasque Ferrari Finished 7 5 53 PÃ©rez Sergio Mexican Red Bull Finished 5 6 53 Sainz Carlos Spanish Ferrari Finished 12 7 53 Stroll Lance Canadian Aston Martin Finished 19 8 53 Alonso Fernando Spanish Alpine F1 Team Finished 4 9 53 Russell George British Williams Finished 20 10 53 Ocon Esteban French Alpine F1 Team Finished 3 11 53 Latifi Nicholas Canadian Williams Finished 11 12 53 Vettel Sebastian German Aston Martin Finished 10 13 53 Giovinazzi Antonio Italian Alfa Romeo Finished 9 14 53 Kubica Robert Polish Alfa Romeo Finished 15 15 53 Schumacher Mick German Haas F1 Team Finished 16 16 41 Mazepin Nikita Russian Haas F1 Team Power Unit 13 17 25 Hamilton Lewis British Mercedes Collision 8 18 25 Verstappen Max Dutch Red Bull Collision 17 19 3 Gasly Pierre French AlphaTauri Suspension 18 20 0 Tsunoda Yuki Japanese AlphaTauri Brakes During this course we can notice a lightning rise of the Finnish pilot Valtteri Bottas. Lets compare for each lap the times done by Bottas and Ricciardo in the lead throughout the race. We can notice that it is at the beginning of the race that Bottas takes delay, in particular during the first lap where his time is much longer than that of Ricciardo. Thereafter from the 12th lap, Bottas has times lower than those of Ricciardo and proceeds to a gradual rise in places. 5.3 More than just a race  We can see on the following graph the proportion of victory of each constructor on the number of realized races. The graph is ordered from left to right according to the decreasing number of victories. If two drivers of the same constructor participate in the same race it is counted as two chances to win and therefore two races. Ferrari has the most wins but a lower proportion than Mercedes or Red Bull for example. Formula One is certainly a sport in which pilots push their performance but it is also a technological competition between constructors. Each constructor wants to recruit the best drivers in order to prove that their technology is the best during the races on the circuits. In the same way, each driver wants to join the most prestigious constructors in order to have more means and the most performing machines. On this graph on the right, we can see the constructors with which each driver has been associated during at least one season since 2000. We have drivers like Verstappen who since the beginning of his career in 2016 is dear the same constructor (Red Bull) and drivers like RÃ¤ikkÃ¶nen who have changed constructors several times (Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, McLaren).
