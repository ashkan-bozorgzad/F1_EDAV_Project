The files contain technical information on tracks, races, constructors and drivers. In addition, data about the performance of the teams and drivers such as lap times and accidents are available. The data was collected by a simple download. However, there is an API that allows to make GET requests using url in order to get specific data ( link ). The data records races, constructor and driver data since 1950. Each record in each file is identified by an unique id allowing to merge the information tables. We have information of an informative nature such as the list of constructors: ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## constructorId constructorRef name nationality url ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 1 mclaren McLaren British http://en.wikipedia.org/w~ ## 2 2 bmw_sauber BMW Sauber German http://en.wikipedia.org/w~ ## 3 3 williams Williams British http://en.wikipedia.org/w~ ## 4 4 renault Renault French http://en.wikipedia.org/w~ ## 5 5 toro_rosso Toro Rosso Italian http://en.wikipedia.org/w~ ## 6 6 ferrari Ferrari Italian http://en.wikipedia.org/w~ We have more technical information like lap times for each race: ## # A tibble: 6 x 6 ## raceId driverId lap position time milliseconds ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;time&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 841 20 1 1 01:38 98109 ## 2 841 20 2 1 01:33 93006 ## 3 841 20 3 1 01:32 92713 ## 4 841 20 4 1 01:32 92803 ## 5 841 20 5 1 01:32 92342 ## 6 841 20 6 1 01:32 92605 "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Formula 1 circuits since 1950 5.2 Italy Grand Prix 2021 (Monza) 5.3 More than just a race ", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Formula 1 circuits since 1950 There are 77 circuits that have hosted a Formula 1 race since 1950. There are different types of circuits: permanent circuits, semi-permanent circuits and circuits created in urbanization like in Monaco. Initially the races were held mainly on circuits in Europe. From the 1980s onwards, Formula 1 races were held on the American continents and then from the 2000s onwards in Asia. A total of 32 countries have already hosted a Formula 1 Grand Prix. Here is a map listing all the circuits practiced since 1950. The number of races being proportional to the radius of the circle. .html-widget { margin: auto; } The 2 most mythical circuits are Monza in Italy and Monaco in Monte-Carlo. There have been 71 and 67 races respectively. 5.2 Italy Grand Prix 2021 (Monza) As said before, the Italian Grand Prix is one of the most prestigious Formula 1 races of the season. In the 2021 edition, 19 drivers were on the starting line. This graph allows us to follow the progress of the race over the laps. We can notice on the 22nd lap a recurrent movement between the drivers. This corresponds to the pit stops which are inevitable at this level of the race for all the drivers. At the finish line, out of the 19 pilots, only 15 crossed it. Here are the reasons: Position laps Last Name First Name Nationality Constructor Status 1 1 53 Ricciardo Daniel Australian McLaren Finished 2 2 53 Norris Lando British McLaren Finished 14 3 53 Bottas Valtteri Finnish Mercedes Finished 6 4 53 Leclerc Charles Monegasque Ferrari Finished 7 5 53 Pérez Sergio Mexican Red Bull Finished 5 6 53 Sainz Carlos Spanish Ferrari Finished 12 7 53 Stroll Lance Canadian Aston Martin Finished 19 8 53 Alonso Fernando Spanish Alpine F1 Team Finished 4 9 53 Russell George British Williams Finished 20 10 53 Ocon Esteban French Alpine F1 Team Finished 3 11 53 Latifi Nicholas Canadian Williams Finished 11 12 53 Vettel Sebastian German Aston Martin Finished 10 13 53 Giovinazzi Antonio Italian Alfa Romeo Finished 9 14 53 Kubica Robert Polish Alfa Romeo Finished 15 15 53 Schumacher Mick German Haas F1 Team Finished 16 16 41 Mazepin Nikita Russian Haas F1 Team Power Unit 13 17 25 Hamilton Lewis British Mercedes Collision 8 18 25 Verstappen Max Dutch Red Bull Collision 17 19 3 Gasly Pierre French AlphaTauri Suspension 18 20 0 Tsunoda Yuki Japanese AlphaTauri Brakes During this course we can notice a lightning rise of the Finnish pilot Valtteri Bottas. Lets compare for each lap the times done by Bottas and Ricciardo in the lead throughout the race. We can notice that it is at the beginning of the race that Bottas takes delay, in particular during the first lap where his time is much longer than that of Ricciardo. Thereafter from the 12th lap, Bottas has times lower than those of Ricciardo and proceeds to a gradual rise in places. 5.3 More than just a race  Formula One is certainly a sport in which pilots push their performance but it is also a technological competition between constructors. Each constructor wants to recruit the best drivers in order to prove that their technology is the best during the races on the circuits. In the same way, each driver wants to join the most prestigious constructors in order to have more means and the most performing machines. On this graph on the right, we can see the constructors with which each driver has been associated during at least one season since 2000. We have drivers like Verstappen who since the beginning of his career in 2016 is dear the same constructor (Red Bull) and drivers like Räikkönen who have changed manufacturers several times (Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, McLaren). We can see on the following graph the proportion of victory of each constructor on the number of realized races. The graph is ordered from left to right according to the decreasing number of victories. If two drivers of the same constructor participate in the same race it is counted as two chances to win and therefore two races. Ferrari has the most wins but a lower proportion than Mercedes or Red Bull for example.
